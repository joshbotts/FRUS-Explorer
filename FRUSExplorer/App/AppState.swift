/// AppState is the root observable state object for FRUS Explorer.
///
/// It holds application-level state that must be accessible across the entire view hierarchy
/// and persists across launches via `UserDefaults`. Injected into SwiftUI's environment at
/// the `App` level so any view can read it without explicit parameter passing.
///
/// Project context: AppState serves as the bridge between the user's active research focus
/// (`activeProjectId`) and the SwiftData/CloudKit layer that stores all user-generated content.
/// Views observe AppState to react to project switching without requiring data migration —
/// switching projects is a state change, never a data migration.
///
/// ## Network Monitoring
/// AppState owns an `NWPathMonitor` and keeps `isOnline` accurate in real time.
/// `FRUSExplorerApp` observes `isOnline` to enable/suspend the `DownloadManager`.
///
/// ## Download Manager
/// `downloadManager` is set once at app launch by `FRUSExplorerApp`. Views that
/// need to trigger or inspect downloads access it via `@Environment(AppState.self)`.
///
/// ## Tag Stores
/// `volumeLevelTagStore` resolves volume-level tag slugs and provides volume-by-tag
/// index queries. `subjectTagStore` provides document-level subject tag lookups.
/// Both are loaded synchronously at init from the app bundle.
///
/// Version history:
///   1.0 — Session 01: initial implementation
///   1.1 — Session 04: SwiftData container injected at App level
///   1.2 — Session 05: NWPathMonitor, downloadManager, downloadQueue wired up
///   1.3 — Session 08: volumeLevelTagStore, subjectTagStore wired up
///   1.4 — Session 10: manifestStore wired up
///   1.5 — Session 19: summarizationService added
///   1.6 — Session 21: backgroundSummarizationService and backgroundSummarizationProgress added
///   1.7 — Session 30: citationMatchingEngine added
///   1.8 — Session 32: added `showSettingsSheet` and `pendingOnboardingAfterReset` for
///          safe post-reset navigation; onboarding flag cleared only after sheet animates out
///   1.9 — Session 40: pendingSearch for cross-view person-mention navigation
